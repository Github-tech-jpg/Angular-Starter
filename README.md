# Angular Starter Project with API Integration

This repository contains a starter template for building Angular applications. The template provides a basic structure for building scalable, modular, and maintainable applications. It uses Angular 15 and follows best practices to provide a starting point for your projects. It's uses api endpoints from this project [.NET Starter Clean Architecture](https://github.com/RobinHaider/dotnet-starter-clean-architechture).

## Getting Started

To get started with the template, you need to clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/RobinHaider/Angular-Starter) and install the required dependencies. You will need Node.js and npm installed on your system. Run the following commands to install the dependencies and start the application:

```sh
cd Angular-Starter
npm install
npm start
```

Once the application is up and running, you can start customizing it to fit your requirements.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of this template follows the Angular recommended best practices. The application is divided into different modules and components, each with a specific responsibility. The architecture follows a modular approach, which makes it easier to maintain and scale the application.

The template contains the following modules:

- Core Module: This module contains services, guards, and interceptors that are used throughout the application.

- Shared Module: This module contains components, directives, and pipes that are shared across the application.

- Pages Modules: These modules contain components, services, and other related functionality for specific features of the application.

## Technologies Used

The template uses the following technologies:

- Angular 15: This is the framework used to build the application.

- TypeScript: This is used to write type-safe code in the application.

- RxJS: This is used for reactive programming in the application.

- Angular Material: This is used for building UI components in the application.

- TailwindCSS: This is used for styling.

## Functionality

The template provides the following functionality:

- [x] Routing and Navigation
- [x] Lazy Loading Modules
- [x] HTTP Requests and Error Handling
- [x] Authentication and Authorization with JWT

## Notes

This starter template is designed to provide a starting point for building Angular applications. It follows best practices and provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications. However, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and you may need to customize it to fit your specific requirements
